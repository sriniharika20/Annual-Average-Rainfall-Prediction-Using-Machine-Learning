Annual Average Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the annual average rainfall based on meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility using a Random Forest Regressor model.
It also provides a simple and interactive Gradio web interface for making predictions directly from user input.

📊 Project Overview

The model is trained on historical weather data to analyze relationships between environmental parameters and rainfall levels.
By applying machine learning, it aims to help forecast rainfall trends for agriculture, water resource management, and climate analysis.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (for data preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (for model training)

Matplotlib (for visualization)

Gradio (for creating an interactive prediction app)

⚙️ How It Works

The dataset is preprocessed by removing unnecessary columns.

The model is trained using a Random Forest Regressor.

The trained model predicts rainfall based on user inputs like temperature, humidity, etc.

Results are displayed interactively using Gradio.
